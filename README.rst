**pymlu** is a library of common Python utilities for data analysis and machine learning.

The ``pymlu`` package contains utilities divided into different modules
based on their main application. For example, the `dautils`_ module defines
utilities for data analysis such as computing statistics (e.g. mean, quantiles)
and generating graphs (e.g. bar chart) based on datasets.
